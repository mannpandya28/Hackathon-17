# android-quiz-app

I developed this project as part of the Hackathon.


The requirements were to create a quiz layout with at least four different Views, and a method that verifies the answers and displays the final results in a Toast. 
I chose to present ten questions about science in a combination of free text answers and multiple choice answers.
